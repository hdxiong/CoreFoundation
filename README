This library is useful for those who are intending to use CFLite or CoreFoundation into their .NET 
projects. It has most corefoundation DllImport declarations and some additional functions wrapped around
the DllImports.

Remember to add this library as a reference to your project
Remember to also add location of the corefoundation dll to the Environmental PATH variable either
programatically or manually

Usage example (C#)
	
	using CoreFoundation; 
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
			
            CFString cfstring = "hello"; //Able to implicitly specify string value only for certain types			
			Console.WriteLine(cfstring.ToString());
			
			//Reading plist files regardless of binary or xml format
			CFPropertyList plist = new CFPropertyList(PATH);
			Console.WriteLine(plist.ToString());
			
			//Casting to CFPropertyList Objects(eg CFArray, CFDictionary...) and reading attributes
			CFDictionary dict = (CFDictionary)plist;
			CFType val = dict.GetValue(KEY_NAME);
			Console.WriteLine("Value of " + KEY_NAME + " is " + val.ToString());
			Console.WriteLine("This dictionary has " + dict.Length.ToString() + " key-value pairs");			
			
        }
    }
